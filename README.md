# MIT Maker Portfolio
This is the Maker Portfolio that I (Josh Piety) submitted with my MIT application. I was accepted Regular Decision to the Class of 2028. I'm keeping it preserved here for anyone who wants to check it out. There are four projects in here and two of them have other GitHub links to look at:

* Brimstone: [https://github.com/joshop/brimstone](https://github.com/joshop/brimstone)
* Starblazer: [https://github.com/BHTY/Starblazer-II](https://github.com/BHTY/Starblazer-II)

If you're reading this while you're working on your application, you got this! The first version of this README literally had "...for when I get rejected in a few months" plastered on it, this process can seem extremely intimidating but if you stick to what you're really passionate about and try to communicate it as best you can, you might surprise yourself. Good luck!!!!!!



If you're reading this having already been admitted, you didn't need that peptalk. ESPECIALLY if you're Liong Ma.
